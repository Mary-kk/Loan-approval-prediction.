## Loan Approval Prediction

## Overview
This project showcases a machine learning pipeline to predict loan approval decisions based on applicant and loan details. The goal is to assist financial institutions in streamlining the loan application process and enhancing decision-making efficiency.

The dataset used for this project can be accessed directly from the following link:

## Dataset
The dataset contains 4,269 entries and 13 features, including applicant demographics, financial information, and loan attributes. The target variable is loan_status, indicating whether a loan was "Approved" or "Rejected."

Key Features:

-**Applicant Details**: Number of dependents, education level, employment status.

-**Financial Information**: Income, loan amount, CIBIL score, and various asset values.

-**Loan Details**: Loan term and associated bank assets.

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied:

Removed leading/trailing spaces in column names.

Encoded categorical features (education, self_employed, and loan_status).

Verified and handled missing values (none found).

Scaled and split the data into training (75%) and testing (25%) sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA included visualizations to explore feature distributions and relationships with loan_status. Key insights:


Higher CIBIL scores are associated with higher approval rates.

Graduates tend to have higher approval rates compared to non-graduates.

The loan amount and income show variations based on loan status.


## Model Development
The project implemented the following models for classification:

-**K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

-**Random Forest Classifier**


## Model Evaluation

Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Key results include:

KNN: Achieved an accuracy of 55%.

Random Forest: Achieved the best performance with an accuracy of 98%.

## Results

The final model provides insights into the factors influencing loan approval decisions and can be used to automate the initial screening process for loan applications.

## Summary 

This project focuses on predicting loan approval by analyzing various factors such as an applicantâ€™s financial history, income, credit score, employment status, and other relevant attributes. Using historical loan data and machine learning algorithms, a predictive model has been developed to assess the likelihood of loan approval for new applicants.

## Future Work

Implement advanced models like XGBoost or Neural Networks for enhanced accuracy.

Explore feature engineering to incorporate additional insights.

Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions.
